## 🖐🏻 Who am I?

Head over to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-sd/) profile for details.

## 🤙🏻 What languages or frameworks?

Current preference is .NET with C# as the main choice for back-end work and ES7 or TypeScript with React for front-end jobs, but any modern language is great to learn more about.

## 👋🏻 Why this profile?

To promote cheese 🧀 and code 🧬. This is where both legacy and recent (public / open source) work goes.
